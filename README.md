# YourBackgroundEverywhere
Browser Extension - Add your favorite background on all websites !

Tired of those boring white backgrounds on every site ?
You should try YourBackgroundEverywhere !

- :leaves: Lightweight, 600Kb only.
- :art: Customisable, change opacity of the background, and active reading mode as you want !
- :handshake: Easy to contribute or modify local, less than 200 lines of Javascript.

## Installation
First, you need to install this repo, on this page, follow the instructions given in the blue `Code` button.
Go the `YourBackgroundEverywhere/insert_your_background_here` folder, and read `README.txt` to find out how to the change the default background.

After it, you have to "pack" the extension, to do so, open your in your browser chrome://extensions, edge://extensions ... ect or click on the top-right corner button (The puzzle piece) > `Manage extensions`.
Then, active the Developper Mode, the button should be in one of the top corners.
Press `Load unpacked` and select the `YourBackgroundEverywhere` folder, not the folder where you're actually reading this, the sub-folder.

And that's it !

I recommand pinning the YourBackgroundEverywhere button, to quickly change your settings.

## Does this really extension work on ALL site ?
Unfortunately, no, some websites aren't comptatible with YourBackgroundEvrywhere, it's often the case when the site use deep-nested <div> or minified CSS class name.
For moment, the know sites that don't work are : `svelte.dev`, `duckduckgo.com`.
